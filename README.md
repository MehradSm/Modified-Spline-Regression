# Modified Spline Regression

This is the repository for our paper titled "Modified Spline Regression for Neual Spiking Data" available on bioRxiv. 
Here we provide our MATLAB code for a simulated neural spiking data. 


### Code

The code is divided to three categoris:

1. The [main.m](https://github.com/MehradSm/Modified-Spline-Regression/blob/master/main.m) MATLAB file contains the main framework to run the experiment. 
2.
